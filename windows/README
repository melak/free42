I keep all the common files in the 'common' directory. In order to build the
Windows version, you must first create links to these files from the 'windows'
directory using the link-files script.

Note: the Free42 workspace contains four projects: Free42Binary, Free42Decimal,
keymap2cpp, and skin2cpp. Before building Free42Binary and Free42Decimal, you
must build keymap2cpp and skin2cpp and run them; this creates the keymap.cpp
and skins.cpp files, which contain the default keymap and the skins to be
compiled into the Free42 executable.

Starting with version 1.5.9, the Windows build of Free42 builds the Intel
Floating-Point library from source. Run build-intel-lib.sh to build the
library; if successful, this will create a file named cl111libbid.lib,
containing x86 objects.
